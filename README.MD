EC463 Team 14: Cayote

The project will consist of the creation of a semi-autonomous, human friendly “robo cayote” which will deter deer from geo-fenced properties using a user-chosen sound. The Coyote will be equipped with a camera, as well as a computer chip that will be running a CV model that’ll be able to detect deer with relative accuracy (goal is 90%) and will send the results to a secure, multi-coyoted, user-friendly platform. The Coyote will be water-proof, rechargeable, and robust.
