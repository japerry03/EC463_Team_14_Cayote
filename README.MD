EC463 Team 14: Cayote


Major Project Components:

-Computer Vision --> Will need to develop AI that'll detect Deer accurately (~95% accuracy)

- Ability to give user/client control immediately (will need to make a network communnication) --> Speed wise, use Bluetooth or WiFi, but will need closer proximity. Could use radio waves to send signals otherwise for longer distance controls. 

    - Will need to form some defensive protocols or encrypt data sent so no one can capture control over the robot manually.

- Must be waterproof and weatherproof, as well as low-cost.

- WIll also need to communicate locations and videos of deer after detection (see above for communication/defense models).

-(MAYBE????)  Reinforcement Learning Agent --> Will need to develop an RL model that'll make decisions on where to move (maybe based on sounds heard?)
