EC463 Team 14: Cayote

<img src="./images/Team 14.jpg" width="50%">


The project will consist of the creation of a semi-autonomous, human friendly “Robo Cayote” which will deter deer from geo-fenced properties using a user-chosen sound. The Cayote will be equipped with a camera, as well as a computer chip that will be running a CV model that’ll be able to detect deer with relative accuracy (goal is 90%) and will send the results to a secure, multi-Cayoted, user-friendly platform. The Cayote will be water-proof, rechargeable, and robust.
